# project

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview (running "npm install" in the same directory as package.json should give you everything you need, but at least one group member had to install grunt separately beforehand "npm install grunt").

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

## Scraping

The code to scrape the data for this project can be found in the "scraping" directory. A config file with database information and passwords is also needed (not in repo)
